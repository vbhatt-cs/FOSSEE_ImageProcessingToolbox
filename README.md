# FOSSEE Image Processing Toolbox

The repo contains files for 2 functions:
<br>stdfilt
<br>multithresh

Both are MATLAB functions implemented in C++ using openCV. 

"im0.png" is the image used in examples.

OpenCV version 2.4.9+ is required to run the functions. 

### Run without compiling

The examples can be directly run using
```
    ./functionName
```
    
where function name is the function that is to be run.

### Compiling the code

The cpp files of the examples can be compiled and run using
```
    make functionName
    ./functionName
```

where function name is the function that is to be run.
